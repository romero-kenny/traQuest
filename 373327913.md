I decided to remake the framework and added better styling and such. File structure will 
be changed later, but I wanted to play with the functionality a bit more without touching 
the main branch much. I got the webpage layout decently, just need to fix the quest 
submission to look nicer and add the interactive quest map. Also need to make the 
completed quest and active quests work. As well as make an accept quest button for the 
quest tracker.
